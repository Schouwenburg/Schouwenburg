Hi 👋, I’m @Schouwenburg, living IT 🧑‍💻,, networking 🌐 and a dev since 👶 which is some time ago.
Sorry that almost all I do is in private repositories because of legal/contract 📝 limitations.
Most of the work 🏗 I do is glueing things together, systems, data sources etc.
Contact me via 🐤 @Schouwenburg
